<h1> LINQ</h1>

<h2> Summary </h2>

This project is all about learning how to take in JSON data in C# and read and filter through it!  When running this 
application you can choose what data, specifcally neighbor hoods in the manhatten area.  You can view just all of the 
no filters.  You can view only neighbor hoods with an actual name or maybe you just wanna know all the unique 
neighbor hood names!  1 and 4 seem like they are doing the same unique neighbor hood print, its how they are done 
that is different, check the source code if youre interested in how I did it!
